"Mandatory Access Control (MAC), refers to a set of access control policies "
"that are mandatorily enforced on users by the operating system. MAC policies "
"may be contrasted with Discretionary Access Control (DAC) protections, by "
"which non-administrative users may (at their discretion) protect objects. In "
"traditional UNIX systems, DAC protections include file permissions and "
"access control lists; MAC protections include process controls preventing "
"inter-user debugging and firewalls. A variety of MAC policies have been "
"formulated by operating system designers and security researches, including "
"the Multi-Level Security (MLS) confidentiality policy, the Biba integrity "
"policy, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Domain and Type Enforcement (DTE), "
"and Type Enforcement (TE). Each model bases decisions on a variety of "

"policies. These interfaces are used by general-purpose tools such as "
"man:ifconfig[8], man:ls[1] and man:ps[1] to view labels on network "

"Applications handle MAC labels in two forms: an internalized form used to "
"return and set labels on processes and objects (`mac_t`), and externalized "
"form based on C strings appropriate for storage in configuration files, "
"display to the user, or input from the user. Each MAC label contains a "
"number of elements, each consisting of a name and value pair. Policy modules "
"in the kernel bind to specific names and interpret the values in "
"policy-specific ways. In the externalized string form, labels are "
"represented by a comma-delimited list of name and value pairs separated by "
"the `/` character. Labels may be directly converted to and from text using "
"provided APIs; when retrieving labels from the kernel, internalized label "
"storage must first be prepared for the desired label element set. Typically, "
"this is done in one of two ways: using man:mac_prepare[3] and an arbitrary "
"list of desired label elements, or one of the variants of the call that "
"loads a default element set from the man:mac.conf[5] configuration "
