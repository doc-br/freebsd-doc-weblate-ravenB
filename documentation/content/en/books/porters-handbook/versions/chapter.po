"Note that 2.2-STABLE sometimes identifies itself as \"2.2.5-STABLE\" after "
"the 2.2.5-RELEASE. The pattern used to be year followed by the month, but we "
"decided to change it to a more straightforward major/minor system starting "
"from 2.2. This is because the parallel development on several branches made "
"it infeasible to classify the releases merely by their real release "
"dates. Do not worry about old -CURRENTs; they are listed here just for "
"reference."
