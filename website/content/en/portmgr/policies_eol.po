"Support of FreeBSD releases by ports and the ports infrastructure currently "
"matches the link:../../security/#sup[policies set out by the FreeBSD "
"Security Officer]. Once a major branch X reaches its EOL date, the \"last "
"known good\" ports tree will be tagged with the `RELEASE_X_EOL` tag as a "
"convenience to those remaining users who intend to self-support their "
"installations. This tag is not supported in any way and security fixes will "
"not be applied. Usage is therefore highly discouraged and should only be "
"used if there is no other option; consumers are expected to provide their "
"own support."

"For all supported major src branches, all ports will be included in an "
"automated quality assurance procedure which will build, install, package, "
"and deinstall each port on all link:{committers-guide}#AEN1259[Tier 1 "
"platforms]. Maintainers and committers are notified of failures detected "
"during testing. Ports that are known not to build or run on a given "
"supported branch and/or platform will be marked as such."

"Prebuilt binary packages will also be provided for all major branches and "
"Tier 1 platforms and will be made available via "
"https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=pkg&sektion=8[pkg(8)]. Package "
"builds will use the oldest supported minor release within each major branch "
"to ensure ABI and KBI backwards compatibility within each major branch, and "
"support all minor versions of each major branch, including `-RELEASE` and "
"`-STABLE`."
